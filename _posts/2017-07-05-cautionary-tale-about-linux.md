title: "A cautionary tale about Linux, courtesy of XKCD"

Because this is a test post, I didn't feel like trying to find a tutorial. So instead, here's a funny comic about the OS **Linux**. 

[XKCD: Cautionary](https://xkcd.com/456/)

XKCD is a comic about: 

* computer geekiness
* coding
* science
* random thoughts that the author has 

the author, Randall Munroe, is a total computer geek who worked at NASA before deciding to make comics. As such, this is a funny comic for anyone who has any idea of computer science--or, if not, people who at least appreciate it.
